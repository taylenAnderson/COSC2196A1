      I am an Australian born in a small town called Salmon located in Idaho USA.
      I grew up on the Mornington Peninsula which is in the south east of Melbourne
      Victoria. My education started off with leaving high school at the end of
      year 11 and moving on to become a qualified mechanic. With this skill I
      was able to work all over the Australian eastern seaboard, in doing so I
      met my now wife by integrating into the Taiwanese community of Sydney
      Australia. My wife and I have since settled down, buying a house in West
      Gippsland and having a child.
