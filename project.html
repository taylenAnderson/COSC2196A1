    <h3 style="color:navy">Project Idea</h3>
    <h4 style="color:white">Overview</h4>
    <p style="color:white">
      I would like to design and develop an automated robot which can be used to map out the internal dimensions of a buildings internal space. It should be able to open doors, climb stairs, crawl under things and climb up into roof spaces, attics etc. It would be required to maintain a repeatable accuracy of its measurements as well as provide the user with multiple output options including a floor plan and photographs for advertising the sale of a property. Ideally this device would be very efficient with its use of time per property and be able to provide this service at multiple properties per day saving tremendously on the manpower cost for preforming home inspections like this in the retail property market.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color:white">Motivation</h4>
    <p style="color:white">
      The primary reason I wish to build and implement a project such as this is when I wanted to purchase my first house with my wife, it was extremely difficult to get accurate measurements or floor plans for any of the houses we were looking at, They simply were not provided in most situations or when provided they were not accurate enough to provide the needed detail to begin quoting for renovations. This made it very difficult to organize our property purchase as we were buying from the other side of Australia and did not have anyone to come and inspect or measure the property for us.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color:white">Description</h4>
    <p style="color:white">
      This will be a self propelled electronic device capable of navigating through a home or other indoor location. It will need to be capable of identifying doors, stairs and other internal fixtures of a home and be able to manipulate them to either enter another room or area of the location, or adequately map them in the floor plan feature. It will also need to be able to ensure safety of people within the property while preforming its tasks by manouvering around them or halting its job instead of causing people harm. It will also be required to navigate the house completely without missing any areas or tell the user when the job is complete or why the job cannot be finished. It should do this using a combination of sensors including GPS, infrared, and multiple cameras.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white">
      The floor plan feature should be able to identify and label the usage of each room based on the furnishings and fixtures in that room (for example if there is a shower in the room it should be identified as a bathroom) and attempt to take a decent photo showing off the room from the best position for advertising purposes. It will be required to show the positions of cabinetry, power outlets (where they are visible), sinks, dishwashers, and other household white goods for sale within the property. All of this information will be accessible from a web interface hosted on the device which can be viewed on any web browser simply by connecting a phone, laptop, tablet or computer to it and navigating to the page. This will allow the device to be platform agnostic making it much easier for companies to integrate into their current property inspection strategy.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white">
      There will also be a simplified touch screen interface allowing the user to start, stop and pause the property scan as well as access basic settings that will be user adjustable. The simple display will also allow previews of the photos taken and provide a way to export the property data to an external media source such as an SD card or USB thumb drive to be uploaded to the real estate website later.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white">
      A learning system will also be implemented where the user can tell the device which photographs are acceptable and which are not in an attempt to make it better at recognizing where it should be taking photos, and also allow the user to edit the machines definition of items should it make a mistake and label a washing machine as a fridge. Using these technologies the product will be able to develop and grow over time and make better decisions and real estate advertisements helping to sell houses, and getting buyers the information they really should have.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color:white">Tools and Technologies</h4>
    <p style="color:white">
      The intended hardware would be either a STM32, ESP32 or Arm based micro-controller depending on the amount of processing power required to preform such a task. There would need to be multiple brush-less motors, controllers, cameras, LEDs, IR receivers and laser distance sensors. From the software side of things multiple different firmware's would have to be designed for the different components. Therefore this project would require a C and C++ compiler such a GCC. It would also require a high level language for the automation purposes, this could potentially be preformed by java script (node.js) which would also allow a simple web interface to be hosted on the device to allow easy communication to the user.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color:white">Skills Required</h4>
    <p style="color:white">
      This project requires a lot of skills to be achieved including C and C++ programming, JavaScript Programming, assembly coding and basic machine learning for obstacle avoidance. The project would require someone to design and manufacture Printed Circuit boards specific to this device, and a 3d printer to build the initial prototype. Also required would be a web developer for making a decent platform for the user to engage with and a robotic engineer to design the kinematics of the robot.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color:white">Outcome</h4>
    <p style="color:white">
      If this project is successful the outcome would be that more people would be able to get an accurate overview of the potential properties they are looking to purchase which would help them make a more informed decision on their purchase. This would solve the original problem because it would improve the transparency between the seller and buyers and provided it worked well may come to be something buyers demand before they even look at a property. I believe this project would reduce the amount of lies that could be told to a potential property buyer to close a sale and help inspire confidence in the property sales market.
