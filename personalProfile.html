    <h4 style="color:white">My Summary</h4>
    <p style="color:white">
      Upon assessment of the results collected, I believe I am and individual who is skilled in problem solving under pressure. I tend to be distant emotionally and thing through things logically therefor having trouble making social connections with others, tending to take control of the situation and find solutions without relying on others to much. I think emotional stability is a weak point for myself and is something I should try to address moving forward as that may have many potential benefits for myself moving forward.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white">
      My behavior in a team could be influenced mostly by my introversion, finding it difficult to communicate with my other team members until I was able to get to know them better, potentially causing issues with others by saying or doing something which may unintentionally upset or insult another member of the team due to my social anxiety. It could positively affect my ability to find solutions on my own to bring back to the team for later reflection and implementation.

    <p style="color:white">
      When forming a team it would be best to pair myself with other strong personalities who have individual skills different to myself, preferentially one of whom having a strong leadership initiative as I work better following a leader than I do attempting to lead.
It may also be beneficial to find a team with a strong sense of direction as I can find it difficult to stick with an idea and develop it to its conclusion.
