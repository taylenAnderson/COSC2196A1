      The position firmware engineer, is for an individual who will be designing
      and writing firmware for devices. The most enjoyable part about designing
      firmware is that you create a very important building block which allows
      a device to function not only with the world around it but also with
      additional devices in a virtual space. The satisfaction you receive from
      assembling basic firmware and having it function as expected in the real
      world, even for something as simple as a blinking LED initially is very
      thrilling for me.

      The skills required for a job like this would be a strong understanding of
      C and C++ programming languages, a decent understanding of assembly code,
      good communication skills and some understanding of the micro-controllers
      you would be working with. The qualifications required would be a bachelor
      degree, or equivalent in one of the software engineering fields (Software
      Engineering, Mechatronic Engineering or Electronics Engineering) as well
      as completing a course in data structures and algorithms using either C,
      C++ or Java (C and C++ skills need to be demonstrated if course was
      completed with java). You would also require experience with GDB
      (GNU Project Debugger), Python or other high level programming language,
      basic understanding of electronics (measurement of voltage, current, noise
      etc.), and experience working with git.

      The skills I currently posses include a strong understanding of
      electronics (designing and building printed circuit boards), a basic
      knowledge of both c and  c++ programming languages obtained from self
      teaching online. I currently hold a certificate 3 in automotive, though
      that would not assist for this position. My current experience involves
      10+ years using and modifying Linux, building Arduino projects and
      developing firmware for them using a slimmed down c language for my
      smart house.
    </p>
    <p>
      My plan to gain the required skills, qualifications and experience
      required to obtain a position like this would involve going back to
      university to study Bachelor of IT, taking elective classes for C++
      programming, Taking a course on data structures and algorithms using C as
      a basis, learning python to a satisfactory level and experimenting with
      the GNU project debugger
